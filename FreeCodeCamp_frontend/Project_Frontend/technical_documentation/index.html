        <p>Minecraft Survival mode is a gameplay mode where players must gather resources, manage hunger, and survive against hostile mobs. Players start with nothing and progress by crafting tools, building shelters, and exploring their world. The goal is to survive as long as possible while advancing in gear and abilities.</p>
        <p>Minecraft provides various blocks, items, and mobs.</p>
        <p>Survival mode relies on collecting and using these resources effectively.</p>
        <p> Gameplay can be extended with optional goals such as defeating the Ender Dragon or Wither.</p>
